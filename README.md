# One App iOS

## Description
*What is the purpose of this project?*

This project is a mobile application for hackers/organizers/mentors/sponsors at the hackathon.  Hackers would be able to get announcements, get a QR code for checking/food/t-shirts, as well as see the schedule and map for the hackathon.  Organizers would be able to scan for checkin/food/t-shirts for analytics that can be used after or even during the hackathon.  Any more ideas to expand this project are always welcome.

## Inspiration
*How did this project come to be?*

We had started using a mobile application to keep track of analytics to get a better idea of how certain aspects of the hackathon were running such as food consumption and optimization for checkin.  This project expanded into a mobile application so hackers had easier access to their QR code as well organizers with their scanners.  We put in more information about the hackathon everyone can stay up to date on events that are happeneing wherever in the venue. 

## Installation Guide
*How do the users get this up and running?*

What do people need in their systems? Is there a hardware requirement?

This will be a native iOS application so at the moment it can only be compiled on a Macbook.
